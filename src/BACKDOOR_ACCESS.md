# Admin/Editor Backdoor Access

## 🔐 Secret Staff Login

To access the admin/editor login page (bypassing the public magic link login), use the secret URL path:

### URL Format:
```
https://yourdomain.com/emoh
```

Or with hash:
```
https://yourdomain.com/#emoh
```

### How It Works:
1. Navigate to `/emoh` (which is "home" spelled backwards)
2. The staff login form (email + password) will appear automatically
3. Enter your admin or editor credentials
4. You'll be logged in with full staff access

### Why "emoh"?
It's "home" spelled backwards - a simple, memorable backdoor that's not obvious to regular users browsing the site.

### Going Back:
Click the "← Back to Reader Login" button to return to the magic link login for students/teachers.

**Note:** This backdoor is for admin and editor accounts only. Students and teachers should continue using the magic link authentication on the home page.
